            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>The Cozy Nook was born from a passion for creating warm, inviting spaces that reflect personality and comfort. What started as a small family-run workshop quickly grew into a beloved furniture destination, offering timeless pieces crafted with care and attention to detail. Our commitment to quality, sustainability, and aesthetic appeal has made us a go-to brand for homeowners and interior designers alike.</p>
            <p>At The Cozy Nook, we believe that furniture is more than just decor; it is an extension of your personal style and a reflection of the moments shared with loved ones. Each handcrafted piece tells a story of craftsmanship, blending modern designs with traditional techniques to ensure durability and elegance.</p>
